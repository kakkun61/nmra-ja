本書は全米鉄道模型協会（National Railway Model Association; NMRA）の「[標準と推奨慣例](https://www.nmra.org/index-nmra-standards-and-recommended-practices)」を翻訳したものです。

## 5種類の標準

NMRA の標準は下記の5種類に分類されます。

- **標準**（Standard; S）
- **推奨慣例**（Recommended Practice; RP）
- **技術的注釈**（Technical Note; TN）
- **技術的情報**（Technical Information; TI）
- **技術的参考文献**（Technical References; TR）

> **Standard (S)** - NMRA Standards are to establish the broadest correlated set of limiting dimensions, electrical parameters and communications parameters within which interchange may be assured. Standards are reviewed by the membership and approved by the Board of Directors.
>
> **Recommended Practice (RP)** - NMRA Recommended Practices do not rise to the level of being a Standard, however, they provide details of various topics that have been found to be the best for interchangeability or operation of products. Recommended Practices are not used in determining the qualification of a product when compliance certification is being judged. Comments are generally made if the product is found outside the recommended practice. Recommended Practices are reviewed by the membership and approved by the Board of Directors.
>
> **Technical Note (TN)** - NMRA Technical Notes supplement the Standards to provide additional guidance on a given subject. Technical Notes are reviewed by the appropriate technical working group and approved by the Manager, Standards & Conformance.
>
> **Technical Information (TI)** - NMRA Technical Information are documents that are used to provide information associated with a Standard or Recommended Practice. Technical Information is reviewed by the appropriate technical working group and approved by the Manager, Standards & Conformance.
>
> **Technical References (TR)** - NMRA Technical References are, for the most part, internal documents that provide a history of action taken in the Standards and Conformance Department. Occasionally a Technical Reference is made public for reference and use by individuals involved with the Standards and Conformance Department. Technical References are reviewed by the appropriate technical working group and approved by the Manager, Standards & Conformance.
